CARD,DESCRIPTION
THE FOOL REVERSED:,"An error of judgement. Bad advice takes you in the wrong direction, 
so investigate all offers carefully. The Fool reversed can also show 
deception. You may also be trying to force a situation, which can 
only backfire."
THE MAGICIAN REVERSED:,"Trickery; great plans have no foundation. This card often warns of 
others' motives, and they may not have your best interest at heart. 
It may also reveal frustration as, although you feel ready to move on, 
you meet restriction at every turn. If you are involved in the arts, 
a creative block is indicated."
HIGH PRIESTESS REVERSED:,"Hidden information that may cause shock or disappointment is about 
to come to light. A secret is revealed that may incriminate someone you 
thought was above reproach. A trusted mentor is not all he or she seems. 
Take care whom you consult and confide in just now, from physics to older 
female relatives."
EMPRESS REVERSED:,"The reversed Empress reveals difficulties with an older woman, such as a 
parent or mother-in-law, possibly involving clinginess or jealousy. Money 
problems at home manifest as miserliness or dangerous overspending. This 
card can also reveal parenting issues, which may involve confrontation."
EMPEROR REVERSED:,"The Emperor reversed is a possessive, stubborn individual who wants to 
control others. You may be the victim, but examine your behavior because 
you may be dominating a person or situation needlessly. Whatever the 
situation, you or someone you know is losing perspective: it's time to 
take a step back. "
HIEROPHANT REVERSED:,"The influence of an oppressive, older person who harangues you with 
unmasked-for advice. Do not be deceived by someone older in years 
because you assume they are wiser. The information may be wrong, 
and they may use their status to manipulate you."
THE LOVERS REVERSED:,"Break-ups and commitment issues: one person may pull away from a 
relationship rather than work through difficulties. Tension mounts as 
imbalance and temptation creep in, such as seeking out an affair as a 
way of avoiding problems. Otherwise, this immaturity may be expressed 
as over dependence on a parent."
THE CHARIOT REVERSED:,"Ego and arrogance bring problems. Progress comes to a halt, or you feel that you 
are going in the wrong direction. On a mundane level, there could be a problem 
with transport, as plans go awry and a journey is delayed or abandoned."
JUSTICE REVERSED:,"In the reversed position, Justice shows a miscarriage or justice. 
A decision goes against you, or a straightforward situation becomes
unnecessarily complicated and the true facts of the matter become 
hidden. Others may act with bias, and you may overlook those who 
can support you at this difficult time. Judge yourself kindly and hold 
fast to your beliefs."
THE HERMIT REVERSED:,"Enforced isolation. Refusal to learn or listen to advice may result in withdrawal
from others in anger or resentment. You may need more time to come to terms
with a situation you do not wish to accept. The Hermit reversed can also show
an over analysis and a tendency to intellectualize rather than allowing feelings 
to surface."
WHEEL OF FORTUNE REVERSED:,"The reversed wheel shows a downturn in fortune. You may have little influence 
over events at this time, but the situation will not prevail. As the wheel goes against 
you, so it can turn again in your favor."
STRENGTH REVERSED:,"Curb baser instincts, such as overindulgence in food or overspending. Difficult 
emotions, such as anger, may need to be dealt with. You may be inclined to run 
away from problems rather than risk confrontation."
HANGED MAN REVERSED:,"Betrayal, often of the self. You may shy away from making a life-changing decision 
because it means initial discomfort or expense, and even yearn to return to the life 
you has as a dependent child. It is time to wake up from the reverie and confront 
whatever is causing anxiety."
DEATH REVERSED:,"An inability to give up what has already been taken. You may be living in the past 
more then you realize. Until you let go of the people or possessions that no longer 
represent who you are, or want to be, new opportunities are blocked. Surrender 
rather than waste time and energy clinging to suffocating familiarity. "
TEMPERANCE REVERSED:,"You may feel overwhelmed, bonded to others' demands and under increasing 
pressure to cope. Money problems are often involved, so it is vital you deal with 
potential debt or resolve a deficit of time and energy."
THE DEVIL REVERSED:,"Obsession, such as an unhappy, destructive affair. When reversed, 
The Devil shows and inability or unwillingness to break a bond that 
has no future, due to immaturity, desperation, or low self-esteem. 
The card may indicate a struggle with addiction."
THE TOWER REVERSED:,"An avoidable disaster. Your worst fears are realized as a relationship, 
business venture, or home project collapses -- and you know that you 
may be partly to blame. However, after anger at the sense of injustice 
comes guilt and, finally, a sense of relief. A struggle ends."
THE STAR REVERSED:,"A creative or an emotional block, arises as a project or partnership 
loses it's way. You need direction, but beware of those who cultivate 
you for their own purpose. You may need to step out of an illusion 
and search for your star elsewhere."
THE MOON REVERSED:,"A failure of nerve. You do not trust your feelings and look to others for 
answers. Over dependence on a mentor figure could show you have 
begun to doubt your instincts. Moonlight can be deceptive -- so 
examine others' motives carefully before you commit. Don't settle 
for second best. "
THE SUN REVERSED:,"Delay & Frustration. Your goal is just out of reach. Work or illness obstruct 
plans, and the paradise you had, envisaged is perilously close to slipping 
away. Vacations are cancelled, or a relationship does not materialize. 
Physically, your energy levels may be depleted."
JUDGEMENT REVERSED:,"Daily, due to the past getting in the way, or fear of change. You may judge 
yourself too harshly, or allow others to disregard your contribution, although 
this may be an excuse for not being able to let go. You may need to 
re-examine your attitudes and overcome feelings of guilt. What counts is 
what you believe about yourself."
THE WORLD REVERSED:,"Restriction. Failure to move forward is often due to indecision or negativity. 
Through feelings of being trapped in the past, or by the needs of others, 
your world seems to be growing smaller rather than expanding to welcome 
new people and opportunities. If you address what is really holding you back 
there is a chance for you to achieve your dream."
