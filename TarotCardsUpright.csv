CARD,DESCRIPTION
THE FOOL UPRIGHT:,"A new path in life; beginnings and opportunities beckon. A time 
to feel hopeful, courageous, and young at heart. However, there 
may be risks ahead, too, so The Fool warns that you look before 
you leap. By all means embark upon a mad adventure or idealistic 
quest for fulfillment, but take heed of the practicalities. The Fool 
also heralds fun, entertainment, and falling in love."
THE MAGICIAN UPRIGHT:,"You are poised to make dreams become a reality. This card often 
marks the time just before an important trip, or the beginning of a 
new project that is about to flourish, symbolized by the growing 
roses and sun. The conditions for success are just right, so take 
action to empower your business, relationships, or other new venture. 
This will feel natural, all you'll be in the flow, and full of energy and 
ideas. Work will feel like a vocation rather than a chore."
HIGH PRIESTESS UPRIGHT:,"New wisdom; your intuition is expanding as you grow in confidence. 
The card often arises when you sense you are on the right path, 
creatively and spiritually. Follow your instincts toward people and 
places, and they may take you to the next level of learning. This is an 
emotional card, revealing deep feelings of work you may do in secret."
EMPRESS UPRIGHT:,"Happiness, beauty and nurturing, harmonious home. A good omen for 
relationships in terms of commitment and stability, The Empress, may 
predict marriage and pregnancy. In a younger person's reading, she can 
reveal the positive influence of a mother or mother-figure, and her 
appearance also shows good health and balanced relationships."
EMPEROR UPRIGHT:,"Protection, advice, and support are forthcoming from a trustworthy man, 
who may be a father-figure or partner. He indicates that order rules -- he 
may be authoritarian and perhaps old-fashioned, but he has strength of 
purpose, so he predicts action. Practical problems, such as with building 
work and money, will be resolved in the long term."
HIEROPHANT UPRIGHT:,"It is time to take sound advice from someone you trust. The Heirophant 
often reveals an authority figure, such as a father, teacher, or other mentor.
He symbolizes practical wisdom, so his influence can help you resolve a 
challenge. This card also denotes a spiritual dimension, so it can indicate 
that you are about to embark on a new course of learning that will bring 
you closer to your soul's purpose."
THE LOVERS UPRIGHT:,"A successful decision is to be made, which is based upon maturity and 
foresight. Previous tensions or conflicts will be resolved. As the card's 
image suggests, it's appearance in a reading can show two people 
reuniting after a period of uncertainty. It advises you to follow your heart 
and intuition if you are to take a leap toward achieving a goal. In practical 
terms, The Lovers can also reveal outgrowing an environment, such as a 
young person leaving home and taking a step toward independence. "
THE CHARIOT UPRIGHT:,"The drive for adventure. As the charioteer uses the force of his will to bring 
together everything he needs for his journey, you move on toward a new 
relationship or career, although The Chariot can also show an important journey, 
learning or drive, or a new means of transport. At this time, you show great 
determination to get where you want to go -- and you will reach your destination. 
The horses represent libido, so there is also the frisson of sexual adventure here. 
The horses, dark and white, echo the dark and light aspects of the journey ahead."
JUSTICE UPRIGHT:,"The favorable conclusion of a dispute or other ongoing concern, 
providing that your success is deserved. Legal matters are resolved, 
from claims over a property to employment issues. As a general 
influence, in a reading, Justice argues for a reasoned, pragmatic 
approach to challenges as opposed to avoidance and denial, or 
extreme responses. Balance is all."
THE HERMIT UPRIGHT:,"Circumstances dictate that you spend time alone. You seek wisdom, 
but to find it you need to distance yourself from familiar surroundings 
and perhaps certain friends or family. Time alone will create perspective, 
and encourage healing. The Hermit also shows a recuperation period 
after an illness or operation."
WHEEL OF FORTUNE UPRIGHT:,"A twist of fate; circumstances change unexpectedly for the better. It is your turn 
to benefit from spontaneous success and joy, as good things come to you without 
effort. Take up every opportunity and appreciate this halcyon time while it lasts. 
This shift in your life may also uncover new creative pathways, such as alternative, 
stimulating career, as well as predicting better time financially. Long term plans 
can now proceed unhindered."
STRENGTH UPRIGHT:,"Courage, Patients, and persistence are needed to face a potentially dangerous 
opponent. If provoked, be prepared to spend time in negotiation, and stand your 
ground. Aims can be achieved with quiet confidence rather then displays of overt 
strength. This card is also about internal conflict and the necessity of accepting 
your shadow side. In a generally positive reading, Strength also symbolizes 
good health."
HANGED MAN UPRIGHT:,"Time out; an opportunity to step back from a situation, such as giving up a belief, 
or perhaps letting go of a dream. As this card literally shows, you may need to hang 
around waiting for someone else to make a decision. In this case, there is little you 
can do but wait. Analyze the situation with detachment and you may see new 
opportunities from a distance, rather than obsess about an outcome you are 
powerless to change."
DEATH UPRIGHT:,"The end of a life-phase; relationships, a career, or even an era comes to a close. 
Accept that this is necessary change -- from a friend you have grown away from, 
to a commitment that has restricted your creativity. When you break outdated ties, 
new people and prospects are free to enter your world. Change is coming, and it is 
better to embrace it than to resist; it may be a blessing in disguise."
TEMPERANCE UPRIGHT:,"Moderation, balance, and patience are essential for the control of volatile influences 
and opposing demands. There is potential for progress as a business, relationship, 
or family grows; use your experience and diplomacy to harmonize conflict and keep 
projects moving forward. This card also suggests reconciliation, so relationships 
can be repaired."
THE DEVIL UPRIGHT:,"Temptation or enslavement to and ideal. Misdirected passion is 
indicated here, such as a dead-end affair, or becoming trapped 
by ambition, perhaps investing energy or money in the wrong 
person or project for short-term gain. There is a danger that you 
urge for power, to rule. The spell can be broken if you are willing 
to make a small sacrifice now to gain something more rewarding 
in the future."
THE TOWER UPRIGHT:,"Shock, loss, and insecurity; the collapse of an ideal or relationship.
The tower is an construction of hope and ambition, which is destroyed 
by the primal energy of fire. This disaster also symbolizes the tower 
of the ego or pride before a fall. What you have fabricated falls 
down, and there is little you can do to avoid the situation or repair 
it. Yet you can begin again, and be all that stronger for it."
THE STAR UPRIGHT:,"Inspiration and guidance; you have clarity or purpose and great 
potential now. The water symbolizes creativity and it's flow, memory. 
As the past and the present flow together, so past experiences give 
you the wisdom to make a dream come true. This is a nurturing card, 
showing that you are tending your garden well. Ideas flourish as you 
create fertile conditions for success and happiness."
THE MOON UPRIGHT:,"A dilemma; grave or suppressed doubts about how to move forward 
in a relationship, project, or other negotiation close to the heart. This 
is a solitary card, so you may need to come to a decision on your own. 
If you feel trapped, look beyond what you think is possible, the dog and
the wolf silhouetted in The Moon are guardians of boundaries, showing 
limitations may be self-imposed. As the emotional moon symbolizes 
intuition, your dreams may hold guiding messages."
THE SUN UPRIGHT:,"Success; time for the good times in life: love, sunshine, rest and play. 
This may be an extended trip, or time to travel farther afield, but the 
message is recuperation rather than adventure. The Sun also describes 
the honeymoon period of a new relationship; in love, you feel like a child 
again, innocent and carefree. The card can also signify children coming 
into your life. The hills shelter the sunflowers from harsh water until they 
are taller, just as a relationship, project, or family is nurtured."
JUDGEMENT UPRIGHT:,"Judgement predicts a significant life change as a project or relationship 
reaches a conclusion. Before you can leave the past behind, you may need 
to examine your conscience and review your previous actions. Judgement 
offers second chances and an opportunity for forgiveness, along with 
financial reward for past efforts that will help your future success. Events 
are about to speed up."
THE WORLD UPRIGHT:,"Success and happiness; a dream come true. Whatever your goal you will 
achieve it and feel satisfied and rewarded. This is a time of celebration and 
joy, when a project is concluded or you commemorate happy occasions, such 
as wedding anniversaries or birthdays. Whatever difficulties you have faced in 
the past, your current triumph is applauded by all. Travel may become 
possible now."
